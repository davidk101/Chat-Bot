## Chat-Bot

A chatbot that communicates via a server from the [Freenode Internet Relay Chat](https://webchat.freenode.net/) network and outputs:-
- weather data of a city using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) when the user inputs "weather *city-name*" into the chat.
- a random tweet from Kanye West when the user inputs "kanye" into the chat.
